            This application will help the <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org" title="The BM website">British Museum</a>'s 
            curator of the Bronze Age collections, Neil Wilkin, to make available a huge card catalogue of 
            British prehistoric metal artefacts discovered in the 19th and 20th century. 
            This information has long been known to be an extremely important untapped resource. 
            Metal finds are not only crucial forms of evidence for dating Britain's prehistoric past, 
            but also tell us a great deal about prehistoric society and economy. 
            Digitising the thousands of objects in this catalogue will
            make these records publicly available via their incorporation into the 
            <a href="http://finds.org.uk" title="PAS website">Portable Antiquities Scheme 
            website</a>. The result will be the largest national database of 
            prehistoric metal finds anywhere in the world and a near comprehensive 
            view of what we currently know about such finds in the UK. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The cards have been scanned and uploaded to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/micropasts/">Flickr</a>, 
            and it is from there that the current application will retrieve and 
            manipulate the scans. These cards contain some fairly standardised 
            kinds of information: about where the artefact was discovered, its 
            dimensions, a longer description of what it looks like, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            What the research team would like people to do, is to transcribe the details 
            from each section on the card into some pre-determined fields, and also to
            attempt to geo-reference the object via its place of discovery.

                Opening the treasures of the Bronze Age to the widest public is why I get 
                up, I would love your help:
